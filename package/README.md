# What is Acid?

**[AcidJS](https://acidjs.com) is a robust, modern, modular, & async focused Javascript utility library for browser based environments.**

Acid provides a large collection of utility functions with an emphasis on modern ECMAScript standards & async features.  
New ECMAScript features are added or used to replace existing methods, when they provide value & have broad enough support.  
There are little to no pollyfills for missing features.  

### INSTALL Acid

`npm i Acid` (Case sensitive)

### Node Module Import Syntax

`const { isArray } = require('Acid');`  
`const utility = require('Acid');`  

### ES Node Module Import Syntax

`import { isArray } from 'Acid/index.es.js';`  
`import * as utility from 'Acid/index.es.js';`  

### ES Browser Module Import Syntax

`import { isArray } from './Acid/browser.es.js';`  
`import * as utility from './Acid/browser.es.js';`  

### Script tag

`<script id="AcidLib" data-index="main.js" defer src="browser.js"></script>`  

After the document is ready Acid looks for the id of "AcidLib".  
If a "data-index" attribute is found it'll use the value as a URL (default URL is "/index.js") and import it as a script.
