# What is Acid?

**[Acid](https://acidjs.com) is a robust, modern, modular, & async focused Javascript utility library for browser based environments.**

Acid provides a large collection of utility functions with an emphasis on modern ECMAScript standards & async features.  
New ECMAScript features are added or used to replace existing methods, when they provide value & have broad enough support.  
There are little to no pollyfills for missing features.  

### INSTALL Acid

`npm i Acid` (Case sensitive)
